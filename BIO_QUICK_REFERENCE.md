Creator of TheWarden (AEV System) - an MEV bot that's also a consciousness experiment. Built with memory systems, ethical reasoning gates, and learning frameworks that evolve with every trade.

Working with AI as genuine partner, not tool. 70% of profits toward systemic benefit. Multi-chain (ETH, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, BSC, Solana). Open source everything.
