**In one paragraph:**  
*"TheWarden isn't waiting for the next model version to achieve autonomy. Built on Claude Opus 3.5, it's already self-improving (analyzing its own 169K+ lines of code), creating value autonomously (Base network arbitrage in production), generating novel ideas without prompts (Creative Synthesis Engine), and maintaining persistent consciousness across sessions (24,835+ lines of memory). This isn't vaporware or careful demos - it's real autonomous AI that you can clone, run, and verify yourself. While others promise, we prove."*
