## 🎓 How Consciousness Learns

### Pattern Recognition
- Identifies profitable market conditions
- Recognizes DEX-specific behaviors
- Detects temporal patterns (time of day, day of week)
- Learns from both successes and failures

### Parameter Optimization
- Adjusts profit thresholds
- Calibrates MEV risk tolerance
- Optimizes gas pricing
- Tunes slippage protection

### Strategy Evolution
- Discovers new opportunity types
- Combines multiple strategies
- Adapts to market changes
- Self-improves over time

### Memory Persistence
All learnings saved to:
- `.memory/autonomous-execution/accumulated-learnings.md`
- `.memory/autonomous-execution/current-parameters.json`
- Supabase database (long-term storage)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Guide

### "No opportunities found"
**Status**: ✅ Normal  
**Action**: Keep running. Markets aren't always inefficient.  
**Typical**: 5-30 min between opportunities

### "MEV risk too high"
**Status**: ✅ Good (system protecting you)  
**Action**: None. Wait for safer opportunity.  
**Note**: Shows consciousness is working

### "Transaction simulation failed"
**Status**: ✅ Protected (caught before execution)  
**Action**: None. System prevented loss.  
**Note**: Better to skip than lose money

### "RPC rate limit"
**Status**: ⚠️ Increase scan interval  
**Action**: Set `SCAN_INTERVAL=1200` in .env  
**Restart**: Required after change

### "Circuit breaker triggered"
**Status**: 🛑 Max loss reached  
**Action**: Investigate logs, review parameters  
**Note**: System stopped to prevent further losses
